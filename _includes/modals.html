                <p>
                    I have learned a great many things from participating in varsity football.
                    It has changed my entire outlook on and attitude toward life. Before my
                    freshman year at [high-school], I was shy, had low self-esteem and turned
                    away from seemingly impossible challenges. Football has altered all of these
                    qualities. On the first day of freshman practice, the team warmed up with a
                    game of touch football. The players were split up and the game began. However,
                    during the game, I noticed that I didn't run as hard as I could, nor did I try
                    to evade my defender and get open. The fact of the matter is that I really did
                    not want to be thrown the ball. I didn't want to be the one at fault if I dropped
                    the ball and the play didn't succeed. I did not want the responsibility of helping
                    the team because I was too afraid of making a mistake. That aspect of my character
                    led the first years of my high school life. All the while, I went to practice.
